#WIP: Developer guide


This guide is made for the developers who might want add their cool
feature to gdeploy.

Why should you add your cool feature to gdeploy, you ask?

Well, If you want to automate your feature deployment using Ansible and
let users use it without editing the playbooks and what not, then adding
it to gdeploy is the way to go.

We expect the developers to know the following:

1. Python(Duh!)
2. Writing Ansible Playbooks(necessary) and modules(worst case)
