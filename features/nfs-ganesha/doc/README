Setup

‚Å†Pre-requisites to run NFS-Ganesha
---------------------------------

1. A Red Hat Gluster Storage volume must be available for export and NFS-Ganesha
   rpms are installed.

2. IPv6 must be enabled on the host interface which is used by the NFS-Ganesha
   daemon. To enable IPv6 support, perform the following steps:
   * Comment or remove the line options ipv6 disable=1 in the
     /etc/modprobe.d/ipv6.conf file.
   * Reboot the system.

3. Ensure that all the nodes in the cluster are DNS resolvable. For example, you
   can populate the /etc/hosts with the details of all the nodes in the cluster.

4. Disable and stop NetworkManager service.

5. Enable and start network service on all machines.

6. Create and mount a gluster shared volume.

7. Install Pacemaker and Corosync on all machines.

8. Set the cluster auth password on all the machines.

9. Passwordless ssh needs to be enabled on all the HA nodes. Follow these steps,
   * On one (primary) node in the cluster, run:
     # ssh-keygen -f /var/lib/glusterd/nfs/secret.pem
   * Deploy the pubkey ~root/.ssh/authorized keys on _all_ nodes, run:
     # ssh-copy-id -i /var/lib/glusterd/nfs/secret.pem.pub root@$node
   * Copy the keys to _all_ nodes in the cluster, run:
     # scp /var/lib/glusterd/nfs/secret.*  $node:/var/lib/glusterd/nfs/

Configuring the HA Cluster
--------------------------

1. To setup the HA cluster, enable NFS-Ganesha by executing the following
   command:
   # gluster nfs-ganesha enable

2. To tear down the HA cluster, execute the following command:
   # gluster nfs-ganesha disable

Exporting Volumes through NFS-Ganesha
-------------------------------------

1. To export a Red Hat Gluster Storage volume, execute the following command:
   # gluster volume set <volname> ganesha.enable on

Unexporting Volumes through NFS-Ganesha
---------------------------------------

1. To unexport a Red Hat Gluster Storage volume, execute the following command:
   # gluster volume set <volname> ganesha.enable off


Adding a node to the cluster
----------------------------

Before adding a node to the cluster, ensure all the prerequisites mentioned in
section Pre-requisites to run NFS-Ganesha is met. To add a node to the
cluster. execute the following command on any of the nodes in the existing
NFS-Ganesha cluster:


 # ./ganesha-ha.sh --add <HA_CONF_DIR> <HOSTNAME> <NODE-VIP>

where:

HA_CONF_DIR: The directory path containing the ganesha-ha.conf file.
HOSTNAME: Hostname of the new node to be added
NODE-VIP: Virtual IP of the new node to be added.

Deleting a node in the cluster
------------------------------

To delete a node from the cluster, execute the following command on any of the
nodes in the existing NFS-Ganesha cluster:

 # ./ganesha-ha.sh --delete <HA_CONF_DIR> <HOSTNAME>

where:

HA_CONF_DIR: The directory path containing the ganesha-ha.conf file.
HOSTNAME: Hostname of the new node to be added

Modifying the default export configuration
------------------------------------------

To modify the default export configurations perform the following steps on any
of the nodes in the existing ganesha cluster:

Edit/add the required fields in the corresponding export file located at /etc/ganesha/exports/.
Execute the following command:

 # ./ganesha-ha.sh --refresh-config <HA_CONFDIR> <volname>

where:

HA_CONFDIR: The directory path containing the ganesha-ha.conf file
volname: The name of the volume whose export configuration has to be changed.

Accessing NFS-Ganesha Exports
-----------------------------

NFS-Ganesha exports can be accessed by mounting them in either NFSv3 or NFSv4 mode.

1. Mounting exports in NFSv3 mode

 # mount -t nfs -o vers=3 virtual_ip:/volname /mountpoint

2. Mounting exports in NFSv4 mode

 # mount -t nfs -o vers=4 virtual_ip:/volname /mountpoint
