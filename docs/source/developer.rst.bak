Developer Guide
===============


With gdeploy, the user get to remotely configure a lot of features in
multiple machines, without worrying dealing with the complexities of
writing Ansible Playbooks, modules, etc. It is the duty of the developer
to worry about all these things. Adding a new feature to gdeploy is
relatively easy, but comes with the cost of writing playbooks and
modules(if necessary) for Ansible. So this guide assumes that the
developer is comfortable with Python and has got the basic working
knowlegde of Ansible.
